# DataStructures
A stubborn undergraduate's efforts to reinventing the wheel from STL and boost to learn data structure and C++. 
He would be honoured to receive any bug report or suggestion from everyone who would like to help.

All Reinvented wheels are in the DataStructures Directory.
Contents of directories:
    DataStructures: Reinvented wheels from STL.
    Test: A directory of random codes when he tries to examine something.
    VectorTest: A project to test APIs of Vector.
    ForwardListTest: A project to test APIs of ForwardList.
    
Current Progress:
    Vector: Fully implemented with no allocator. Roughly tested.
    ForwardList: Everything except for algorithms such as split and merge, 
    as well as non-member functions such as operator== are implemented.
    Every implemented function is roughly tested.
    
Feel free to take break down these code. I would be happy to receive every bug report, if there will be any.
