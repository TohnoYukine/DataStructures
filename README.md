# DataStructures
A stubborn undergraduate's efforts to reinventing the wheel from STL and boost to learn data structure and C++. <br />
He would be honoured to receive any bug report or suggestion from everyone who would like to help.<br />

All Reinvented wheels are in the DataStructures Directory.<br />
Contents of directories:<br />
    DataStructures: Reinvented wheels from STL.<br />
    Test: A directory of random codes when he tries to examine something.<br />
    VectorTest: A project to test APIs of Vector.<br />
    ForwardListTest: A project to test APIs of ForwardList.<br />
    
Current Progress:<br />
    Vector: Fully implemented with no allocator. Roughly tested.<br />
    ForwardList: Everything except for algorithms such as split and merge, <br />
    as well as non-member functions such as operator== are implemented.<br />
    Every implemented function is roughly tested.<br />
    
Feel free to take break down these code. I would be happy to receive every bug report, if there will be any.<br />
